# ML2R software repositories

The Competence Center Machine Learning Rhine-Ruhr (ML2R) connects pioneering research institutions to establish cutting-edge research, to support young scientists and to strengthen the technology transfer in companies. To support these goals, we maintain this GitHub page as a hub for the software we develop, be it fully-fledged libraries or experiments that supplement our scientific publications.
