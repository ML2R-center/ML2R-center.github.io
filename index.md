# ML2R software repositories

The Competence Center Machine Learning Rhine-Ruhr (ML2R) connects pioneering research institutions to establish cutting-edge research, to support young scientists and to strengthen the technology transfer in companies. To support these goals, we maintain this GitHub page as a hub for the software we develop, be it fully-fledged [libraries](#libraries) or [experiments](#experiments) that supplement our scientific publications. Also check out [our website](https://www.ml2r.de)!

## Libraries

- [CriticalDifferenceDiagrams.jl](https://github.com/mirkobunse/CriticalDifferenceDiagrams.jl): Plot critical difference diagrams in Julia.
- [MetaConfigurations.jl](https://github.com/mirkobunse/MetaConfigurations.jl): Define a set of configurations (e.g, to specify experiments) as a single, more abstract and comprehensive *meta*-configuration.

## Experiments

- [Optimal Probabilistic Classification in Active Class Selection](https://github.com/mirkobunse/acs-icdm20), supplementing the publication by M. Bunse, D. Weichert, A. Kister, and K. Morik at ICDM 2020.
